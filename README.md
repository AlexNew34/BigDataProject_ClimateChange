# Big Data Analysis Project: Climate Change
The analysis is primarily done using RStudio. The first file to use is the 'Cleaning.R' file, which uses the downloaded online data files as .csv files. The .csv files are cleaned and the 'Cleaning.R' script creates additional .csv files which are used in the second script 'EDA.R'.
The second script 'EDA.R' puts all the cleaned datafiles into one dataframe. This script also creates visualisations of the data.
The third script is 'MLR.R' which creates a Multiple Linear regression model for the data.
The fourth script is 'RidgeLasso.R' which creates the Ridge and Lasso regression models for the data.
The fifth script is 'ElasticNet.R' which creates the Elastic Net regression model.
The sixth script is the 'RandomForest.R' which creates the Random Forest model.
Lastly, the seventh script is the 'DecisionTree.R' which creates a Decision Tree model.
